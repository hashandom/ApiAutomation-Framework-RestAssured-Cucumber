# Rest Assured API Automation Framework

This project demonstrates automated API testing using **Rest Assured** in Java. The framework is designed to validate and automate REST APIs including integrations with Jira, Excel data sources, and secure authentication mechanisms.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Java
- Maven
- Rest Assured
- TestNG / JUnit
- Apache POI (for Excel)
- Jackson / Gson (for JSON deserialization)
- OAuth 1.0 / 2.0
- Jira REST API

## 📌 Key Features

### ✅ API Test Automation with Rest Assured
- Build robust and reusable test cases for REST APIs using Rest Assured.
- Assertions and validations for status codes, headers, and response bodies.

### 🧩 Deserialization
- Convert JSON responses into Java objects using libraries like Jackson and Gson.
- Helps simplify complex validations and response body parsing.

### 🔐 OAuth Integration
- Secure APIs using OAuth 1.0/2.0 authentication flows.
- Token-based authentication for accessing protected endpoints.

### 📊 Excel Integration
- Read test data from Excel sheets using Apache POI.
- Data-driven testing for multiple input scenarios.

### 🐞 Jira API Automation
- Automate Jira operations such as:
  - Creating issues
  - Updating issues
  - Searching and deleting issues
- Perform CRUD operations on Jira tickets using Jira REST APIs.

### 🔍 API Validation
- Validate status codes, headers, and response content.
- Schema validation using JSON Schema.
- Response time and performance checks.

### 🔄 API Generation (Mock/Swagger)
- Automatically generate or test against Swagger/OpenAPI-defined APIs.
- Stub or mock API endpoints for test isolation (if needed).
